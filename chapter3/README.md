## Chapter 3 - Transcriptomic analysis of PyNOT1-G paralogue

The NOT1G gene is a part of CAF1/CCR4/NOT complex that is known to play a crucial role in Plasmodium parasite development. 

To identify the role of NOT1G gene, specifically in the blood stage developmental phase of the parasite, we conducted transcriptomic analyses.

This chapter focuses on the differential expression analysis between the wild type and NOT1G knockout _P.yoelli_ blood stage parasites.

All commands used in the analysis are put together in a Makefile.

The scripts used in the Makefile are in `src` folder.
