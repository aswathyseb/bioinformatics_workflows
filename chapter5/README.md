## Chapter5 - DNA Marker Database for Metabarcoding

A tool for creating DNA marker database that can be customized to accommodate various organisms, taxa groups and marker sequences is available [here](https://github.com/aswathyseb/markerdb)

The database could be used as a reference in metabarcoding applications such as species identification and biodiversity assessment.
